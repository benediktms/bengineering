Moving the home directory to a separate partition
(or a separate drive) can solve the problem of backing up
and restoring data/configs when installing, as new distro.

<br />

It is relatively simple to do with a new installation,
since you can choose the mount points.

1. The new home partition needs to be properly formatted as a new drive. You can use GParted or a similar tool to set this up
2. check which blocks are available with `lsblk`. Your root partition as well as your empty drive should be visible
   1. assuming you have 2 partitions your current Linux installation should be in `sda/sda1` and your new partition should be `sdb`
3. You will need a new temporary directory and mount it:
   ```
   sudo mkdir /mnt/tmp
   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp
   ```
4. You will then need to copy your home directory to the temporary partition:
   ```
   sudo rsync -av /home/ /mnt/tmp
   ```
5. Mount the new partition:
   ```
   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home
   ```
6. Check that all your files are in the home directory
7. Unmount (in lazy mode if necessary) the new home directory:
   ```
   sudo umount -l /home
   ```
8. Drop into a TTY prompt and log in
9. Remove your home directory (MAKE SURE YOU TARGET THE CORRECT FOLDER!!):
   ```
   sudo rm -rf /home/*
   ```
   - Alternatively you can simply rename your home directory and create a new empty directory as the mount point:
     ```
     sudo mv /home /homebackup
     sudo mkdir /home
     ```
10. Add the new home directory to the `fstab`:
    ```
    sudo blkid
    ```
    - Copy the UUID for your new partition, in this example it would be `sdb1`
    ```
    sudo vim /etc/fstab
    ```
    - Paste the UUID (including the string "UUID=") onto the last line (`file system`). Set the mount point (`type`) to `/home` enter the the file system type (`options`), probably `ext4`, and set the `dummp` to `defaults` and `pass` to 0 2
11. Reboot the machine. You should have a home directory. Check your mounts to ensure you are actually using the right home directory `cat /proc/mounts`
