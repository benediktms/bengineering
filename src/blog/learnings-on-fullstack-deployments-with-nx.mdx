I recently started working on a new side project called [Hivemind](https://github.com/benediktms/hive-mind).
It is the first 'big' project that I'm working on by myself (not counting this blog). By big I mean that I am
building it with the intention of it eventually being 'production ready', and everything that this entails
(authentication, multiple features, etc.).

I won't spend much time talking about the tech stack, since it isn't relative to the scope of this article,
but I will mention that it is an [Nx](https://nx.dev/) monorepo, and that it uses JWT and HTTPOnly cookies
for authentication.
