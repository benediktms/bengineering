I'm a bit of a late bloomer when it comes to software development (better late
than never, though!). I didn't study computer science and I did not start
professionally working in this amazing field until 4 years after I had graduated
university. I'm excited to learn more about the web development ecosystem

<br />

I'm a pretty practical person. I learn by just trying and failing. But there are
a lot of smart people out there on the web teach a lot of really cool stuff.

<br />

One such resource is a podcast that you may (propably) already know: <StyledLink to={'https://changelog.com/'}> The Changelog</StyledLink>.
An episode that I listened to recently had

<StyledLink to={'https://twitter.com/swyx'}> Shawn 'swyx' Wang</StyledLink> as guest.
Swyx is also a self taught developer. I'm always interested when I hear others from
a non traditional background share their stories.

<br />

One thing that he talked about was a concept he calls 'Learning in public', which
is based around the idea that if you put your 'skin in the game', meaning that if
your name is behind something like a blog post it incentivises you to learn whatever
it is you are discussing properly (or better), because people are open to criticising
and correcting you (which people love to do). So I wanted to try this out for myself.
You could say it was the motivational 'push' I needed to try to start my own blog
and start learning in public.

<br />

So hopefully I (and if you're reading this, you too) can learn a few things by using
this practical approach.
